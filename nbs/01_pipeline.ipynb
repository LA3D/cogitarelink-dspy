    "This notebook implements structured agent pipelines for the Cogitarelink-DSPy integration. We're creating agents that can reason about semantic web data across different layers of abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context Layer** - Working with JSON-LD contexts and namespaces\n",
    "2. **Ontology Layer** - Exploring ontologies and vocabularies\n",
    "3. **Rules Layer** - Validating data against rules (SHACL, etc.)\n",
    "4. **Instances Layer** - Working with actual data/triples\n",
    "5. **Verification Layer** - Verifying and signing data\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we have a **Utility Layer** for cross-cutting concerns like memory and telemetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach uses DSPy's `StructuredAgent` which provides a framework for tool selection and execution based on the user's query. We'll implement two levels of agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HelloLOD`: A lightweight agent with essential tools for common tasks\n",
    "- `FullPlanner`: A comprehensive agent with all available tools\n",

    "1. **System prompts** that explain the semantic web layers and guide tool selection\n",
    "2. **Agent implementations** at different capability levels (HelloLOD, HelloLODWithMemory, FullPlanner)\n",
    "3. **Memory integration** to learn from past interactions\n",
    "4. **Testing utilities** to validate agent behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "These components form the foundation of our semantic web agent architecture, enabling sophisticated reasoning across the different layers of the semantic web stack. The agents can now be integrated into applications to provide semantic web capabilities through natural language interfaces."
