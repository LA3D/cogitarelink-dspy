    "This notebook implements structured agent pipelines for the Cogitarelink-DSPy integration. We're creating agents that can reason about semantic web data across different layers of abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context Layer** - Working with JSON-LD contexts and namespaces\n",
    "2. **Ontology Layer** - Exploring ontologies and vocabularies\n",
    "3. **Rules Layer** - Validating data against rules (SHACL, etc.)\n",
    "4. **Instances Layer** - Working with actual data/triples\n",
    "5. **Verification Layer** - Verifying and signing data\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we have a **Utility Layer** for cross-cutting concerns like memory and telemetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach uses DSPy's `StructuredAgent` which provides a framework for tool selection and execution based on the user's query. We'll implement two levels of agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HelloLOD`: A lightweight agent with essential tools for common tasks\n",
    "- `FullPlanner`: A comprehensive agent with all available tools\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also integrate memory capabilities to enable the agent to learn from previous experiences."

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've implemented a layered approach to semantic web agents using DSPy's structured agent framework. The key components we've created are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **System prompts** that explain the semantic web layers and guide tool selection\n",
    "2. **Agent implementations** at different capability levels (HelloLOD, HelloLODWithMemory)\n",
    "3. **Memory integration** with a training pipeline based on a curriculum dataset\n",
    "4. **Evaluation metrics** to measure performance on memory tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation follows Jeremy Howard's step-by-step approach:\n",
    "- Starting with simple, working demonstrations\n",
    "- Building complexity incrementally\n",
    "- Documenting each step clearly\n",
    "- Testing components in isolation before integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps would be to:\n",
    "1. Run the training with a real LLM\n",
    "2. Expand the curriculum dataset to cover more semantic web tasks\n",
    "3. Implement advanced techniques like reflection garbage collection\n",
    "4. Create a full evaluation suite for comprehensive testing"
